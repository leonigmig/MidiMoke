The software uses the concept of time as a fundamental element, to create music with a sense of pace, rhythm, structure, and organization, which aligns with the way the brain processes information to create a sense of a coherent and emotionally engaging whole. This structure and organization takes account of the way the brain's cells and tissues have evolved to regulate complex behaviors.

- rhythmic dynamics in the brain, specifically in the striatum, which is involved in movement, reward, and decision-making.
- storytelling and narrative, as they align with the concepts of characters, goals, reward and punishment
- The concept of fractal fluctuations and oscillations that regulate brain waves

Striatal pathways

- The direct pathway is responsible for initiating voluntary movement and is involved in the regulation of muscle tone.
- The indirect pathway is involved in the inhibition of movement and is thought to be responsible for maintaining postural stability.
- The hyperdirect pathway is the fastest and most direct connection from the cortex to the basal ganglia and is involved in the regulation of movements that require rapid responses, such as reflexive movements.
- The mesolimbic pathway is involved in the regulation of reward and reinforcement, and is thought to be a key component of the brain's reward system. This pathway is activated when a person experiences pleasurable sensations, such as those associated with food, sex, and drugs.

One area of research that is relevant to emergence in generative art is the study of . Striatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making and has been observed in several interacting frequency bands. However, the mechanisms underlying these rhythmic dynamics, their interactions, and their functional consequ

ences are not well understood.

The mirror neuron system is a neural system that is involved in the ability to understand and imitate the actions and intentions of others. It is a network of neurons that are activated both when an individual performs a specific action themselves, and when they observe another individual performing the same action. These neurons are called mirror neurons because they "mirror" the actions of others, in the sense that they respond in a similar way to both observing and performing the same action.
