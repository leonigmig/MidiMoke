Time
----

1/ If time were to move backwards, it would fundamentally alter the way in which the universe works and the way in which matter and energy behave (which is  observed not to be the case).

2/ The cells and tissues of the brain have evolved to a structure and organization that regulates complex behaviors and that is why the world is the way it is right now.

3/ The brain's perception of time is determined by sensory input and the cycle of the "brain" around the  mind, the body, the spirit and the soul.
