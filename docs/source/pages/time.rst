Time

Time is the most fundamental thing. If it were to move backwards, it would fundamentally alter the way in which the universe works and the way in which matter and energy behave.

It forms the stream for our recurrent neural pathways, constantly "consuming" our own state in the moment, processing information and coming to new understanding.

Brainwaves
==========
- High gamma (dompaminergic) [60-100hz]
- Low gamma (spontanous) [40-60hz]
- The beta (spontanous) [15-30hz]
- The theta (dompaminergic) [4-8hz]

The whole thing can synchronise, which connects to rhythm seeking. Music with a strong beat and rhythm can activate the release of dopamine in the brain, leading to a feeling of pleasure and triggering the reward system. 

In addition to dopamine, music can also affect other areas of the brain, such as the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex, which are involved in emotions, memory, and attention. This may help explain why music can have such a profound impact on our mood, our memories, and our ability to focus and concentrate.

Moment 
======
- The blink (300ms) [3hz]
- The heartbeat (500ms to 1s) [2hz to 1hz]
- The breath (5s) [0.2hz]

The tactus is a musical term that refers to the pulse or beat that serves as the underlying rhythmic foundation of a piece of music. For example, a tempo of 60 bpm (beats per minute) would correspond to a frequency of 1 Hz (1 cycle per second) vs 180 bpm being 3 Hz.

Research has shown that the perception of rhythm and the ability to keep time with a pulse are associated with activity in the basal ganglia and other brain regions, including the auditory cortex and the cerebellum. These areas are involved in motor control, attention, and the processing of sensory information, and they play a crucial role in our ability to perceive, process, and produce rhythmic patterns.

Association
===========
- The sentence / phrase (10s)
- The paragraph / verse / stanza (1m)e
- The song / story (2m+)

When we listen to music, we step into a neural workspace that is specifically tuned to the different elements of the music, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony. When we hear a word, phrase, or idea, our brains automatically begin to search for related concepts and associations, drawing on our past experiences and knowledge to create new connections and ideas. 

We enrich the evidence of our senses by drawing on our memories and learning to create new connections and ideas, weaving together concepts and themes to create a coherent and meaningful whole. We step into neural assemblies that allow the brain to selectively process and integrate the different musical elements, creating a coherent and flexible representation of the music.

A human life
============
- The day (sunrise, noon, sunset)
- The week (work, rest, play)
- The month (new moon, full moon)
- The year (winter, spring, summer, autumn)
- The decade (childhood, youth, adulthood)
- The century (life, death, history)

That is because cells and tissues of the brain have evolved in time to a structure and organization that regulates our. complex behavior. And these complex behaviors are why the world is why the world is the way it is right now. The brain's perception of time is determined by sensory input and the :ref:`Four Looping Pathways` of the "brain" around the  mind, the body, the spirit and the soul.
