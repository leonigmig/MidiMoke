The whole thing can synchronise, which connects to compulsive rhythm seeking and reward.

Many of the concepts and constructs can be related to storytelling and narrative.

- Stories often revolve around characters who have a goal or desire that drives the plot forward.

- Stories often include elements of reward and punishment, such as the protagonist achieving their goal or facing consequences for their actions.

- Melody and harmony can create expectations in the listener by setting up a particular musical phrase or chord progression. The resolution of these expectations can create feelings of reward, while the lack of resolution can create feelings of punishment.

- Social behavior, stress response and memory formation, can be related to storytelling and narrative through the concept of emotions and social connections. Stories evoke emotions in the audience and create a sense of connection to the characters and the plot.

- Storytelling and narrative develop through visual imagery and sensory details. Stories often rely on visual imagery and sensory details to create a sense of immersion and realism.

- The concept of fractal fluctuations and oscillations, which are involved in the regulation of brain waves, can be related to storytelling and narrative through the concept of rhythm and timing. Storytelling often relies on the use of rhythm and timing to create a sense of pace and tension.
