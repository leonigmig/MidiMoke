The spirit is constantly "consuming" itself in the moment, processing information and coming to new understanding. The whole thing can synchronise, which connects to compulsive rhythm seeking and reward.

Narrative 
---------

Many of the concepts and constructs can be related to storytelling and narrative.

- Stories often revolve around characters who have a goal or desire that drives the plot forward. Stories often include elements of reward and punishment, such as the protagonist achieving their goal or facing consequences for their actions.

- Melody and harmony can create expectations in the listener by setting up a particular musical phrase or chord progression. The resolution of these expectations can create feelings of reward, while the lack of resolution can create feelings of punishment.

- Social behavior, stress response and memory formation, can be related to storytelling and narrative through the concept of emotions and social connections. Stories evoke emotions in the audience and create a sense of connection to the characters and the plot.

- Storytelling and narrative develop through visual imagery and sensory details. Stories often rely on visual imagery and sensory details to create a sense of immersion and realism.

- The concept of fractal fluctuations and oscillations, which are involved in the regulation of brain waves, can be related to storytelling and narrative through the concept of rhythm and timing. Storytelling often relies on the use of rhythm and timing to create a sense of pace and tension.


Ontology
========

The only true reality is one, unchanging, and indivisible, and that all change and plurality are mere illusions. there is a distinction between what is necessarily true and what is contingently true. grounded in the workings of the human mind itself. The word and the breath are therefore manifestations of this. 


This structure and organization takes account of the way the brain's cells and tissues have evolved to regulate complex behaviors.

- rhythmic dynamics in the brain, specifically in the striatum, which is involved in movement, reward, and decision-making.
- storytelling and narrative, as they align with the concepts of characters, goals, reward and punishment
- The concept of fractal fluctuations and oscillations that regulate brain waves
- The Four Looping Pathways, the Body, Mind, Spirit, and Soul

Striatal pathways

- The direct pathway is responsible for initiating voluntary movement and is involved in the regulation of muscle tone.
- The indirect pathway is involved in the inhibition of movement and is thought to be responsible for maintaining postural stability.
- The hyperdirect pathway is the fastest and most direct connection from the cortex to the basal ganglia and is involved in the regulation of movements that require rapid responses, such as reflexive movements.
- The mesolimbic pathway is involved in the regulation of reward and reinforcement, and is thought to be a key component of the brain's reward system. This pathway is activated when a person experiences pleasurable sensations, such as those associated with food, sex, and drugs.

Plus 

- oculomotor control, motor control, limbic emotional processing, and reinforcement learning (assoiciative)

the ventral striatum with reward; the caudate nucleus with cognition; and the putamen with motor control

logos, eros

attention, working memory and learning
regulating planned, goal directed behavior

One area of research that is relevant to emergence in generative art is the study of . Striatal oscillatory activity is associated with movement, reward, and decision-making and has been observed in several interacting frequency bands. However, the mechanisms underlying these rhythmic dynamics, their interactions, and their functional consequences are not well understood.

The mirror neuron system is a neural system that is involved in the ability to understand and imitate the actions and intentions of others. It is a network of neurons that are activated both when an individual performs a specific action themselves, and when they observe another individual performing the same action. These neurons are called mirror neurons because they "mirror" the actions of others, in the sense that they respond in a similar way to both observing and performing the same action.
